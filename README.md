# RoomBooking
Room Booking Application enables Teachers, pedagogical counsellors as well as other CEGEP staff members required to book a room 
in the Montreal campus either for an exam or a meeting. 
This makes the app more useful When issues like overbooked spaces and underused areas surface. 
Room Booking Mobile Application makes it easy for workplace leaders to understand and manage space inventory, 
from meeting room booking permissions to office, room reservations, and more.
